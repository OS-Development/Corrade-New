            Finds the most probable label (category) for the item that hasn't been seen before.
            Given unknown item, finds N the closest known and labeled items. With that information produces the rankings for all labels.
            Label's rank is calculated as an average distance to its N closest items.
            Current implementation has N set to infinity.
